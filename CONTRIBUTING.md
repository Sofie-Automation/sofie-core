# Contribution guidelines


Before you contribute to this repository, please read the **[contribution guidelines for the Sofie project](https://nrkno.github.io/sofie-core/docs/for-developers/contribution-guidelines)**.


## About branches

This repository uses the following branches:

* **master** is our main branch. We consider it stable and it is used in production.
* The **releaseXX** branches are our in-development branches. When a release is ready, we decide to "freeze" that branch and create a new **releaseXX+1** branch.

Check the [Sofie Releases page on github](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARelease+) to see the current status of the Sofie releases.


We encourage you to base your contributions on the latest **releaseXX** branch, alternatively the **master** branch or a recently frozen **releaseXX** branch.

# Sofie: Helper Libraries

This folder houses a yarn workspace with various helper libraries that follow the same versioning and release cycle as Sofie core.

These libraries are referenced by core directly, so should behave the same as if `npm link` was used.

There are a few commands defined at this level to do operations on the libraries in parallel.

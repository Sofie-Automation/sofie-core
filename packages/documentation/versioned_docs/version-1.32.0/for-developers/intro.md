# For developers

The pages below are intended for developers of any of the Sofie-related repos, or blueprints.

A read-through of the [Concepts & Architectures](../features-and-configuration/concepts-and-architecture.md) is recommended, before diving too deep into development.

* [Libraries](./libraries)
* [Contribution Guidelines](./contribution-guidelines)

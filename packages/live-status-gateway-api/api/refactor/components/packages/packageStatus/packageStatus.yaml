      Status:
      * `unknown` - status not determined (yet)
      * `ok` - no faults, can be played
      * `source_broken` - the source is present, but should not be played due to a technical malfunction (file is broken, camera robotics failed, REMOTE input is just bars, etc.)
      * `source_has_issues` - technically it can be played, but some issues with it were detected
      * `source_missing` - the source (file, live input) is missing and cannot be played
      * `source_not_ready` - can't be played for a non-technical reason (e.g. a placeholder clip with no content)
      * `source_not_set` - missing a file path
      * `source_unknown_state` - reported, but unrecognized state
